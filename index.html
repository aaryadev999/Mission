<hr>
<h2 style="color: skyblue; background: green;">Our environment is not in the best condition. We humans have polluted our environment beyond repair! Here are some steps we can follow to save the environment from further damage: <br><br><br> Reduce, Reuse and Recycle<br>	Volunteer for cleanups in your community<br>Conserve water<br>Shop wisely<br>Plant a tree<br><br>Our environment is also affected by Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise Pollution and Land Pollution. if we bring our focus on Land Pollution, we find that Land Pollution is mostly caused by cutting trees. It can also be caused by construction of huge buildings taking up space and causing lack of greenery. To solve this problem we can plant more trees, and construct lesser buildings. Proper disposal of plastics will also help.<br><br>Next we will be bringing our focus on Water Pollution.<br>Water Pollution is mostly caused by oil-leaks from ships, and humans throwing plastic in the water. This harms the marine animals. To fix this problem we can start creating eco-friendly ships, and we can stop throwing plastic in the water.<br>Next, we have Air Pollution.<br>Air Pollution is mostly caused by Big Truck, Cars, and Big Factories. To stop this we can control toxic factory smoke, use public transport, and avoid crackers.<br>Lastly we have Noise Pollution.<br>Noise Pollution is mostly caused by trafic, crackers, and construction sites. To stop noise Pollution, we can wear ear-plugs when construction work is going on, turning off appliances when not in use, and ban of crackers.<br>These were all the types of Pollutions and how we can solve the different issues.<br><br>The next topic i am going to talk about Global Warming. The first question that comes to mind is what is Global Warming? <br>In short, Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system. The next question that comes in mind is, How is Global Warming Caused?<br>As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sunâ€™s heat. This leads to global warming and climate change. Now, Some facts about Global Warming: <br>Since 1870, global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner. Now that you know about Global Warming and Pollution... We will discuss about some facts on Our environment! <br><br>Around 27,000 trees are cut down each day just to produce toilet paper<br>100 acres of rainforests are cut down every minute<br>Only less than 4% of American forests remain today<br>One single recycled edition of the New York Times newspaper could save 75,000 trees<br><br>Thats all for the text part of this Mission!<br></h2>
